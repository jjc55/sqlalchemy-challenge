### Module 10 Challenge SQL Alchemy

In this challenge, I used SQL Alchemy to perform a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii. In part 1 of this assignment, I started by using SQL Alchemy to connect to my SQLite database. Then, I queried for the most recent date in the dataset and queried for precipitation data. Afterwards, I created a Pandas DataFrame, a plot, and a table of summary statistics using this information. Next, I performed an analysis on stations by quering for the number of stations, most active station, and 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) for the most active station. I developed a Pandas DataFrame and a histogram using station data. In part 2 of this assignment, I designed a Flask API and created the following routes to fetch data: precipitation, stations, tobs, start date, and start/end date.
